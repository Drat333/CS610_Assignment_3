Implement and automatically run test cases for a directed acyclic graph (DAG), a type of directed graph with no cycles (i.e., there is no path from any node to itself). The DAG datatype would take an input string of nodes with their outgoing edges to initialize the graph. The DAG datatype has a container of its nodes; the nodes datatype hold references to its outgoing neighbors. The DAG also contains functions to determine if it is indeed a DAG (ie. check for cycles), get the incoming edges of a node, get the roots of the graph, get the number of edges in the graph, and to print the graph as an adjacency matrix. All functions had to implement very efficient algorithms in order to be accepted.
